# Recorder.js

A library for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes. This is a version which supports encoding the audio using libopus ver 1.1 compiled with emscripten.

### Syntax
#### Constructor
    var rec = new Recorder([config]);

Creates a recorder instance. Instantiating an instance will prompt the user for permission to access the audio input stream.

- **config** - An optional configuration object (see **config** section below)


---------
#### Config

- **enableMonitoring** - (*optional*) If you want the hear the recorder input live. Defaults to false
- **bitDepth** - (*optional*) Specifies the bitdepth to record at. Defaults to 16. Supported values are 8, 16, 24, 32. If recordOpus is true, this value will be forced to 16.
- **bufferLength** - (*optional*) The length of the buffer that the internal JavaScriptNode uses to capture the audio. Can be tweaked if experiencing performance issues. Defaults to 4096.
- **numberOfChannels** - (*optional*) The number of channels to record. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo. Defaults to 1. More than two channels has not been tested.
- **onReady** - (*optional*) Callback when the stream has been initialized.
- **recordOpus** - (*optional*) Specifies if recorder should record using the opus encoder. Defaults to true.
- **sampleRate** - (*optional*) Specifies the sample rate to record at. Defaults to device sample rate. If different than native rate, the audio will be resampled using a linear interpolation algorithm.  If recordOpus is true, this value will be forced to 48000.
- **workerPath** - (*optional*) Path to recorder.js worker script. Defaults to 'recorderWorker.js'

#### Instance Methods

    rec.startRecording()

**startRecording** will begin capturing audio if the stream is ready.

    rec.pauseRecording()

**pauseRecording** will keep the stream and monitoring alive, but will not be recording the buffers. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will add to the current recording.

    rec.doneRecording()

**doneRecording** will cease capturing audio and disable the monitoring and mic input stream. To start recording again, **initStream** will need to be called and authorization to access the input stream will be required again.

    rec.reset()

**reset** will clear the data buffers of any recorded data and re-initalize the web worker.

    rec.enableMonitoring()

**enableMonitoring** will pass the input stream to the destination node. Headphones are recommended if enabling monitoring to avoid feedback noise.

    rec.disableMonitoring()

**disableMonitoring** will disable the live monitoring of your mic input.

    rec.getWav( callback[, mimeType] )

**getWav** will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to "audio/wav").

    rec.getOgg( callback[, mimeType] )

**getOgg** will generate a Blob object containing the opus encoded recording in an Ogg container. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If audio was recorded as Wave, an error will be thrown. In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to "audio/ogg").

    rec.get( format, callback )

**get** will return the recorded audio in format (supported values are "wav" or "ogg") as a Uint8Array to the callback. If the format type is not supported an error will be thrown. This method will do nothing if a recording is in progress.

    rec.getRecordingTime()

**getRecordingTime** will return the duration of the recorded audio in ms.

    rec.initStream( callback )

**initStream** will initialize the input stream and call the callback on success. This is called internally when recorder is instantiated. This should only be needed if doneRecording() was called and the input stream has be terminated.


---------
#### Static Methods

    Recorder.isRecordingSupported()

Will return a boolean value indicating if the browser supports recording.
